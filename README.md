One of the most important topics in computer science, particularly in machine learning, is the compression and optimal use of available space. Proper compression can also speed up basic operations such as adding, deleting, searching, and modifying an element.                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                           
In the field of machine learning, the matrix data structure is one of the most widely used data structures. Therefore, in this small project, we will focus on the compression and correct representation of a large-scale matrix.
